# SSISAdventureWorks

## Objectives
This project aims to create an environment where needed data to perform sales performance such as data about customers, products, and locations are stored in a data warehouse. Also, to facilitate the process of decision-making, the following tasks should be conducted as the target of this project:
- A data warehouse;
- A multidimensional cube;
- Valuable information about sales performance.

## Data
Adventure Works Cycles (AWC) database (specifically AdventureWorks 2019) will be used in this project as a use case. This database will be divided into many source types in order to address the multi-source data management challenges.
